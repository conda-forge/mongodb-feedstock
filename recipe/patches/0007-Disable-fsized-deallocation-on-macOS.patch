Subject: [PATCH 07/18] Disable -fsized-deallocation on macOS

The check passes on older SDKs, but the compilation still fails
SConstruct should be updated to use something similar to:
https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/commit/98753aa7

Drop this patch when MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is updated to 10.12+
